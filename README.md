## Welcome to my ePortfolio

My name is Acacia Holliday and I will be graduating from Southern New Hampshire University in October of 2020 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. This portfolio serves as my capstone and repository for personal works I intend for the future. It will also be a site where future employers can check on for an assessment of my professionalism. One of the most important things I learned while completeing my degree is that I will inevitably come upon issues I don't know how to solve on my own. I've learned research techniques, how to get past cryptic documentation, reviewing and explaining my code to myself and others, and learning from those with greater expertise. Additionally I've had a chance to collobarate with team members by performing pull requests, stashing, cherrypicking etc with git in my coursework. I've communicated with stakeholders in my education such as Veterans Affairs Voc Rehab and my teachers to make sure that I am putting forth my best work and getting everything I need. My degree has given me the chance to create my programs under a prompt, utilize data structures such as if, else, case statements, objects, classes, for, and while loops, I have worked with relational and nonrelational databases, SQL and mongoDB, and learned about secure coding principals, such as code quality, memory managment like buffer overflows,  and string formatting hacks such as SQL injection that can cause the code to be abused.  

The first project in this repo, the lvlbot is a Discord bot that rewards users for helping others and messaging on the server with cookies and experience points respectively. The users can also issue commands to check their rank or the leaderboard in either cookies or experience points. This project, while not entirely unique showcases my software engineering because I coded it from scratch outside of my coursework, its evolved over several iterations and includes algorithms and data structures such as for loops, functions, and if statements. Previous coursework with working with SQL came in handy as I incoporated a SQLite Database to save the information that is stored by user interactions (the original implementation used JSON). For security the bot's token has been removed from the repo to prevent someone from using the bot in an unintended or malicious way.   

### Discord lvlbot 
I created this item because I had an incentive to create it for a non profit program to help children to learn to program, I wanted a way to gamify their chat space, this artifact showcases skills in working with the discord.api and SQL querying knowledge. The artifact was improved by transferring the storage from JSON to SQLite, adding a leaderboard command and a rank command, I also included a cookie mechanic to separate those being thanked and those being messaged along with an accompanying cookie rank and leaderboard command

Lessons learned by completing this project include finding the correct SQL statement for my purposes and doing a little research on usage of functions like DESC and LIMIT. Also, l learned the cursor returns a tuple and I had to use indexes of the fetched result to access the correct value.By enhancing this project I learned to work with Python's datetime module, parse time into a string and use formatting with f' strings. I faced some challenges with formatting and querying the time entries, but eventually overcame them with research and asking for help.
